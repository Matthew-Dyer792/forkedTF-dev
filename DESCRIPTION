Description: Current position weight matrices and sequence logos are not adequate to model transcription factor binding sites that are composed by a mixture of homodimer and heterodimer complexes. We introduce forkedTF, an R-library that combined functions to design Forked-Position Weight Matrices (FPWM) and Forked-Sequence Logos to better portray TF dimers. forkedTF uses and produces standard objects facilitating the exportation of FPWM to third-party software.
